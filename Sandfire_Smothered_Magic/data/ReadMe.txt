I hope that you can understand this since the assets are meant for my own Game "Sandfire"
It would feel kind of wrong to see my own game assets in other games, which release before mine.
If you edit and change a texture, please ask me beforehand if you want to use one of the textures for your own project.
	If so please contact me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kmitt91

Main inspirations:

The main layout and some of the spells are heavy inspired by the mobile game MADODU and MADOSA by 111%
